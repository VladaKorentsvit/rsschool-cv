### About me
****
Currently I work as a Production Director in chemical engineering branch. I lead the development of equipment for analytical laboratories, mainly for oil and gas.
Due to life changing situation I was looking forward for finding different solutions to obtain more freedom in my career and finally decided to change my vector. Thereby my choice fell on javascript development. Now I'm a student in RS school trying my best.
